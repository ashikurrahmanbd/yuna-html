            <p>
              I created UX strategy and divided the UX activities/deliverables
              into two parallel tracks. The strategy was planned to align
              CareFirst FEPOC's brand identity with the desired user experience
              at every user touchpoint. Based on the UX Strategy, I closely
              worked with the product teams on product roadmaps to keep
              usability a top priority at every stage of development.

              I used lightweight concepting and quick wireframes to kick off the
              process, and kept the deliverables light and editable. The goal
              was to get the core components of the idea or workflow visualized
              quickly and in front of the team and encourage early feedback. We
              kept the investment at each phase lean and minimal that
              rethinking, reconfiguring or redesigning wouldn't crush in
              workload.

              I led the effort of using the UX Maturity Model as a framework to
              assess UX-related strengths and weaknesses of CareFirst's digital
              products. We used that assessment to determine which of the 4
              stages our organization currently occupies and how to advance to
              the next stage, and ultimately the Customer Experience level. I
              also took the lead to develop the enterprise UX Process and UX
              Wiki site. UX strategy was planned based on the Maturity Model and
              Process.

              Prior to starting work on a new project, I always conducted
              <strong>Heuristic Review</strong> on the UI against Nielson
              Norman's usability principles. The analysis resulted in a list of
              potential usability issues ranked by UX scores and severity
              levels. <strong>Competitive Analysis</strong> was also included to
              provide strategic insights into the features, functions, flows,
              and feelings evoked by the design solutions of competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I presented the results with both qualitative and quantitative
              findings to the stakeholders and project teams.

            </div>
            <p>
              I led the effort of <strong>User Interviews</strong> and
              <strong>Focus Groups</strong> both in person and remotely.
              Sometimes, we observed how participants perform their primary
              tasks while having them describe what they are doing through their
              interaction with our product in their natural habitat and context
              of use. I encouraged the team to use
              <strong>Rainbow Spreadsheet</strong> so we were able to
              collaboratively observe UX research sessions and record detail
              findings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>UX Metrics</strong> such as success, time and error were
              also carefully captured to provide the quantitative data.

            <p>
              I led the UX and project teams to conduct interviews and data
              analysis to ensure that <strong>Persona</strong> and
              <strong>Journey Maps</strong> are derived from research with real
              users. We created persona for each CareFirst's primary user group,
              and journey map for each primary task. The user journeys we
              created start before users even engage with our products, and
              continue after they leave.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end, we superimposed the key journeys onto the existing
              sitemap diagram to look for gaps between various channels and to
              understand where the experience falls through.
            </p>

            Post iteration, I worked towards creating an app named Experiaa!
            which intended to service the gift-giving process. Planned as an
            assistant for users, the app developed from a combination of the
            previously mentioned features and an outcome of a series of user
            testings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used <span>paper wireframes</span> to conduct user testings, a few
            insights that came out of these 5 people user testing were -
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The initial design had multiple features that made the app complex
              and difficult to understand for the user- for the next prototype I
              focused on designing an MVP for the first phase which had the
              potential to develop into a business in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              The home screen lacked a search button which made it difficult for
              the users to look for specific products.
            </li>
            <li>
              The users wanted to get notifications regarding upcoming events as
              birthdays and anniversaries that could help them plan gifts in
              advance.
