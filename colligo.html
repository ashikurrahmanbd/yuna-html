For Colligo Complete, I was there from the ideation stage towards a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to the prototype stage.</p>
                <p>I led a core team of 2 designers, with the supports from 2 product managers and a development team of 30 programmers.</p>

                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>In 2015, Colligo planned to create a new killer app that provides enterprise workers an efficient way to access the most relevant data and messages across many backend systems. Since there were already some apps with similar concept in the market (but not yet successful), we spent a great amount of time on analyzing competitors/target users and defining core features that can distinguish Colligo Complete from other similar apps.</p>

                <p>Based on the key pain points we defined, the goal of Colligo Complete is to provide enterprise workers a more efficient way to access the most relevant data and messages across many backend systems, online and offline, anywhere. Although we knew that the app could grow to be something much larger and more robust, we focused on creating a MVP that meets the user's core needs - coping with information overload.</p>
                <p>In order to identify and move forward with the best solutions as quickly as possible, we iterated through many ideas using card sorting, sketching, wireframing, and mockups. To begin with, we focused on solving the key pain points on the most important screens and then moved to the others. During the design process, more than 5 rounds of wireframes/prototypes were tested using in-lab one-on-one solution interviews, 8 test participants each round.</p>

                <p>We then conducted solution interview using the wireframes and prototypes created during each iteration. Test participants consisted of existing marketing contacts and early adopters collected from the MVP demo page - 3 customers and 5 users per iteration.</p>

                <p><span>I would change,</span> I would want to focus on one feature instead of taking multiple at once - this will help me design usable and interactive user flow from end to end, currently the application has multiple immersive features in it - I would rethink the MVP plan of the product and create a phasing for the same. Since it was a short duration sprint, I could not focus on design elements such as color palettes and iconography, which I would like to do. </p>
