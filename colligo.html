            <p>
              Through the design sprint, we understood how to gain understanding
              about the user, identify their needs in order to come up with
              rational and justified solutions to be tested and iterated through
              user interviews. What else? How to have fun doing that!
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this exercise is to get experience creating a
              hypothesis, gathering quick feedback to validate or invalidate the
              hypothesis, iterating upon the feedback received, and testing
              again.

          <p>
            I led a variety of projects at Colligo - everything from landing
            pages and branding guidelines to new apps and setting up systems for
            their current apps to continue rapid development. For Colligo
            Complete, I was there from the ideation stage towards a Minimum
            Viable Product (MVP) to the prototype stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led a core team of 2 designers, with the supports from 2 product
            managers and a development team of 30 programmers.

          <h3>The challenge</h3>
          <p>
            In 2015, Colligo planned to create a new killer app that provides
            enterprise workers an efficient way to access the most relevant data
            and messages across many backend systems. Since there were already
            some apps with similar concept in the market (but not yet
            successful), we spent a great amount of time on analyzing
            competitors/target users and defining core features that can
            distinguish Colligo Complete from other similar apps.

            In the exploratory phase, I focused on taking the insights learned
            from stakeholders, existing users, and non-users. I worked with the
            marketing team to conduct online surveys, focus groups and
            interviews with representative users in order to define target
            users, key pain points, and the core features.

          <h4>Design approach</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the key pain points we defined, the goal of Colligo
            Complete is to provide enterprise workers a more efficient way to
            access the most relevant data and messages across many backend
            systems, online and offline, anywhere. Although we knew that the app
            could grow to be something much larger and more robust, we focused
            on creating a MVP that meets the user's core needs - coping with
            information overload.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to identify and move forward with the best solutions as
            quickly as possible, we iterated through many ideas using card
            sorting, sketching, wireframing, and mockups. To begin with, we
            focused on solving the key pain points on the most important screens
            and then moved to the others. During the design process, more than 5
            rounds of wireframes/prototypes were tested using in-lab one-on-one
            solution interviews, 8 test participants each round.

            A MVP demo site with screenshots of the most recent prototypes with
            'Try it for free' & 'View features' buttons was created using HTML &
            CSS, in order to identify the core features (features that get the
            most clicks), collect interested customers and users' emails, and
            get customers while building.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then conducted solution interview using the wireframes and
            prototypes created during each iteration. Test participants
            consisted of existing marketing contacts and early adopters
            collected from the MVP demo page - 3 customers and 5 users per

            On the right hand side, there is a time-ordered series of events

            The 'Project' feature is what Colligo tried to propose with its CEC
            console system, where companies or managers can push configurations
            and target specific content to their workers. For instance, when
            workers log in to the app for the first time, they will have all
            needed work files ready in their 'Project' folders.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Users can also configure their own customized 'Projects.' They can
            specify keywords, data types and applications.

            and interactive user flow from end to end, currently the application
            has multiple immersive features in it - I would rethink the MVP plan
            of the product and create a phasing for the same. Since it was a
            short duration sprint, I could not focus on design elements such as
            color palettes and iconography, which I would like to do.
