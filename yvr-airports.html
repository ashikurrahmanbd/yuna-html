I then analyzed their Google Analytics numbers to define more precisely what their passengers need/want and how we could better assist them with moving more efficiently through YVR airport. Stakeholder interviews were also used to gather requirements and constraints.</p>

                    <li>Information of wait time at security and customs for the At The Airport card.</li>
                    <li>Ability of tracking multiple flights and creating multiple Journeys to encourage user registration.</li>
